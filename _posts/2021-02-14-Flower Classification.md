This project focuses on classifying flowers based on the IRIS Data-set using the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method.

# The Data

The figure below shows the distribution of the Data-set using seaborn visualization.

The Data-set includes the following information,

A total of 150 rows of flower data with 3 different species,
    
- virginica
- setosa
- versicolor

*sepal_length* - ranging from 4.3 to 7.9

sepal_width	- ranging from 2 to 4.4

petal_length - ranging from 1 to 6.9

petal_width - ranging from 0.1 to 2.5

# The Model

In order to train the model, 2/3 of the data was used and 1/3 for testing.

```python
x_train, x_test , y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    x,
    y,
    test_size = 1/3
)
```

The KNN model using 5 nearby neighbors,

```python
model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5)
model.fit(x_train, y_train)
```

The model parameters are as follows,

    KNeighborsClassifier(
        algorithm='auto',
        leaf_size=30, 
        metric='minkowski',
        metric_params=None, 
        n_jobs=None, 
        n_neighbors=5, 
        p=2,
        weights='uniform'
    )


# Evaluation
